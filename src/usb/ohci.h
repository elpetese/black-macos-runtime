/*
 * ohci.h -- the Xbox USB host controllers, enough of them to be found.
 *
 * A title reaches its gamepad through XAPI, which is statically linked into
 * the image and drives the OHCI controller registers directly rather than
 * going through anything this runtime can shim. Half-Life 2 registers a 4 KB
 * block at 0xFED00000 and takes an interrupt vector for it, then reads
 * HcRevision out of an aperture backed by zeroed RAM, concludes there is a
 * host controller with no root hub ports, and enumerates nothing.
 *
 * The model answers the registers, walks the control and periodic lists the
 * driver builds in guest memory, keeps the frame clock (HcFmNumber and
 * HccaFrameNumber) and delivers the controller interrupt from its own thread.
 * One emulated XID gamepad sits on HC0 port 1 and reports port 0 of the host
 * input layer: an SDL pad, the terminal keyboard, or RECOMP_INPUT_SCRIPT.
 * Black enumerates it, reads its XID descriptor and polls its reports with
 * this. Bulk transfers and isochronous endpoints are not modelled.
 *
 * Windows traps the registers with VirtualProtect and a VEH decoder; POSIX
 * hosts get them through xbox_mmio_intercept.
 *
 * Written from the OHCI 1.0a specification and this title's own code.
